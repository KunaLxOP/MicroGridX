# MicroGridX - Blockchain Solution for Decentralized Microgrids

## Project Description

MicroGridX is an innovative blockchain-based platform designed to revolutionize the management of decentralized microgrids and local energy credit systems. This smart contract solution enables peer-to-peer energy trading, transparent energy production tracking, and automated credit distribution within local energy communities.

The platform leverages Ethereum blockchain technology to create a trustless, transparent, and efficient ecosystem where energy producers and consumers can interact directly without intermediaries. Grid nodes can register themselves, record their energy production, earn credits, and trade energy with other participants in the network.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a sustainable and democratized energy ecosystem where:

- **Energy Independence**: Communities can achieve energy self-sufficiency through decentralized microgrids
- **Fair Energy Trading**: Transparent and automated peer-to-peer energy transactions without traditional utility intermediaries  
- **Incentivized Green Energy**: Reward system that encourages renewable energy production and efficient consumption
- **Community Empowerment**: Local communities have full control over their energy resources and trading decisions
- **Environmental Impact**: Reduced carbon footprint through optimized local energy distribution and renewable energy adoption

## Key Features

### Core Smart Contract Functions

1. **Grid Node Registration (`registerGridNode`)**
   - Secure registration system for new energy nodes joining the microgrid
   - Unique identification and naming system for each participant
   - Automated tracking of registration timestamps and node status

2. **Energy Production Recording (`recordEnergyProduction`)**
   - Real-time tracking of energy generation by registered nodes
   - Automated credit calculation and distribution (1 kWh = 10 credits)
   - Transparent energy production history and statistics

3. **Energy Credit Trading (`tradeEnergyCredits`)**
   - Peer-to-peer energy credit trading between grid nodes
   - Automated validation of transactions and credit transfers
   - Complete transaction history and audit trail

### Additional Features

- **Node Management**: Administrative controls for node activation/deactivation
- **Transaction Tracking**: Comprehensive logging of all energy trades and credit transfers
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Real-time network statistics including total nodes, credits, and transactions
- **Credit Balance Management**: Individual credit balance tracking for each grid node
- **Energy Consumption Monitoring**: Tracking of energy usage patterns across the network

### Security & Transparency

- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions ensuring only registered nodes can participate
- **Data Integrity**: Immutable blockchain records of all energy transactions
- **Smart Contract Auditing**: Transparent and verifiable contract logic
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive event emission for all major contract activities
